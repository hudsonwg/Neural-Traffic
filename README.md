Traffic Light Load Balancer with Neural Network
===============================================

This project implements an Epsilon Bellman Q-learning algorithm to optimize stoplight timers in custom traffic systems.

The project implements a simple UI which allows users to draw custom traffic networks, and then apply the algorithm to optimize them.
